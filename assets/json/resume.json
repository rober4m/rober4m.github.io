The Bolivian Andes, as a large dry region, represents an important source of renewable energy. However, the altitude and high wind energy resources of the Bolivian Andes require further knowledge and understanding of the wind energy resources. In this study, the GWA have been used to determine the total area available to install wind farms considering the protected areas, roads, cities and transmission lines."},{"name":"WRF model parameterization around the highland Titicaca Lake.","publisher":"Earth and Space Science","releaseDate":"2021","url":"https://doi.org/10.1029/2021EA001649","summary":"The computational advances and many times the lack of meteorological measurements in some regions of the world impulse the employment of numerical methods for covering this deficiency of data, and the parameterization is a key factor for use and operation of numerical weather prediction models.
