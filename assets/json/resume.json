      "summary": "Wind resource assessment is a key factor for the development and implementation of wind farms with the purpose of generating green, eco-friendly and clean electricity. The Bolivian Andes, as a large dry region, represents an important source of renewable energy. However, the altitude and high wind energy resources of the Bolivian Andes require further knowledge and understanding of the wind energy resources. In this study, the GWA have been used to determine the total area available to install wind farms considering the protected areas, roads, cities and transmission lines."

The Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) as one of the most important models has been scarcely parameterized in the Bolivian Altiplano and Titicaca Lake."

However, the implementation of efficient wind farms requires accurate data and measurements. This work analyses the MERRA-2 satellite datasets to compare and complement it with WRF simulations in different regions and altitudes in Bolivia, such as the Altiplano, Amazon and Chaco.."
