I am a researcher and engineer specializing in wind energy, air quality, and environmental modelling. My work integrates computational fluid dynamics, numerical simulations, and data-driven analysis to understand, predict, and optimize complex atmospheric systems.


I hold a PhD in Wind Energy from the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Belgium, and my doctoral research focused on assessing high-altitude wind energy potential in the Bolivian Andes, combining advanced numerical modelling with real-world environmental challenges.
